### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Anh Phan and I am currently studying Mathematics at St. Olaf College. My interest is spanned across many different things from âœ¨ Math âœ¨ (Absolutely!), Data Science, Machine Learning, ..., I just simply a believer of using numbers into real world problems. 
I am currently focusing on Applied Math and Data Science, but i I also work on small challenges or fun stuffs that I found around me like small iOS app, or just implementing fun algo that I found. 

Feel free to look around and give any suggestions on any of my project. ^^
